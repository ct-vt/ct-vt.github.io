# More About CORGIS

The **CORGIS project** aims to transform early computer science projects by introducing real-world data via simple-to-use client libraries. Data Science offers an authentic context for your students to solve real-world problems with programming. The CORGIS project has over 40 libraries for subjects such as politics, education, literature, construction, and more!

CORGIS offers full support for Java, Python, and Racket, in addition to making its data files available in common data formats like JSON and CSV. Some datasets are also available through our unique Visualizer platform, which enables data science exploration directly within the browser!

# More About BlockPy

**BlockPy** is a web-based Python environment that lets you work with blocks, text, or both. Designed for Data Science and equipped with powerful tools like the State Explorer and Guided Feedback, BlockPy lets students solve authentic, real-world problems.

The goal of BlockPy is to give you a gentle introduction to Python but eventually mature you into a more serious programming environment (such as Spyder or PyCharm). Long-term, we may support some game/animation design stuff that Scratch/Snap does, but that's not the real goal.

The BlockPy project is aimed at solving some hard technical problems: having a block-based environment for a dynamic language can be tricky - are a given pair of square brackets representing list indexing or dictionary indexing? Our goal is to use advanced program analysis techniques to provide excellent support to learners.

BlockPy owes much of its power to Google's Blockly project, the Skulpt project, Codemirror, and a host of other libraries. For a complete list, see the project GitHub.
